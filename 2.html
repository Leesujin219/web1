      Gris's works from late 1916 through 1917 exhibit a greater simplification of geometric structure,
    a blurring of the distinction between objects and setting, between subject matter and background.
    The oblique overlapping planar constructions, tending away from equilibrium,
    can best be seen in Woman with Mandolin, after Corot (September 1916) and in its epilogue,
    Portrait of Josette Gris (October 1916; Museo Reina Sofia).
    The clear-cut underlying geometric framework of these works seemingly controls the finer elements of the compositions; the constituent components,
    including the small planes of the faces, become part of the unified whole.
    Though Gris certainly had planned the representation of his chosen subject matter,
    the abstract armature serves as the starting point.
    The geometric structure of Juan Gris's Crystal period is already palpable in Still Life before an Open Window,
    Place Ravignan (June 1915; Philadelphia Museum of Art).
    The overlapping elemental planar structure of the composition serves as a foundation to flatten the individual elements onto a unifying surface,
    foretelling the shape of things to come. In 1919 and particularly 1920, artists and critics began to write conspicuously about this 'synthetic' approach,
    and to assert its importance in the overall scheme of advanced Cubism.
